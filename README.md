# Artificial-intelligence-Projects
A collection of artificial intelligence projects to help my 
understanding of AI. 

By the completing these various projects I hope to gain a better 
understanding of artificial intelligence, I have lots of experience 
with most of the modules in these projects but I will document everything 
as well as I can so anyone trying to follow along is welcome to do so.

## Machine Learning Using Keras 

### Basic Image Classification
This will be the first neural network i will build. It will classify 
objects in images using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), this is a 
popular library used in machine learning, check out the [additional information](#tensorflow)
for a brief intro to TensorFlow.

Python Source Code for this project can be found [here](/Machine%20Learning%20using%20Keras/Basic%20Image%20Classification.py)


## Additional Information 
### TensorFlow 
TensorFlow is an open source software used for data flow and large-scale
machine learning. It provides a front end API making it easy to create 
code while executing the code in C++ to maintain efficiency. 

It can train and create neural networks for:
* Handwriting Classification,
* Image Recognition,
* Sequence-to-Sequence models for translation and chatbots,
* Natural Language Processing (similar to above),
* Simulations,

How does it work?
It allows you to create data flow graphs (Graphs which show how data 
moves through a graph), where every node in the graph represents a 
mathematical operation, and each connection/edge is a multidimensional
array of data. They can be trained on any device, the resulting model
can be deployed on almost any device. 

Why use TensorFlow?
TensorFlow allows you to develop these models without having a complete
understanding of how it's working. Throughout the project I will improve
my knowledge of how it works at a more fundamental level but tensorflow 
is a good starting place for beginners. 

## Additional Resources
* [Tensor Flow tutorials](#https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
    * these are excellent tutorials walking you through all of the code,
    in fact i followed these tutorials throughout the completion of my 
    this repo.
